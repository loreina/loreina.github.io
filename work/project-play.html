   In August 2014, my best friend and I co-founded Project Play, a student-run non-profit organization using creative mediums to
   empower youth, educate, and promote change. In my role, I was responsible for a gamut of fields including design, communications,
   publicity, sponsorship, and sales.
   <br><br>
   Diving into the non-profit sector, we navigated by trial and error to find solutions in each discipline.
   Specifically with design, the ambiguity of running our own organization meant starting a design system and style from scratch.
   <br><br>
   This trajectory helped to define my style and approach to design, as seen through an overview of my work below.
  </p>

  <div class="work__subheader">Creating our logomark</div>
  <p>
  <br>
   When we first started Project Play, we weren't sure of the direction we wanted to go into. With a clean state, we opted for
   a simple text logo with our name.
  <br><br>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="six columns offset-by-three"><img class="work__img" src="../img/work/project-play/logo-black.png" data-action="zoom"/></div>
  </div>
  <br><br>
  As we grew into a bigger team and started to build upon our ethos, we wanted to rebrand with a proper logomark.
  We wanted an icon that people could easily identify us by and wasn't too convoluted with different things.
  Following the notion of simplicity, I built the logo out of familiar shapes that made up the letter "P".

  <div class="work__subheader">Colours</div>
  <p>
  <br>
   Thinking about colour psychology and the best way to appear "professional", especially as a team of high school students, we initially
   chose a colour palette with blues. It represented trust and loyalty, which when speaking to sponsors and local businesses, needed to be
   affirmed constantly to alleviate the concerns of partnering with teenagers.
  <br><br>
  <img class="work__img" src="../img/work/project-play/palette-blue.jpg" data-action="zoom"/>
  <br><br>
   Throughout our operations and learning from experience, we realized that we wanted to appear more fun and creative. We looked at changing
   our colour palette from blue to either green or purple. In the end, we decided upon green as it reflected our "paperless" principle and our
   mission to promote environmentally conscious with every event we held.

<div class="twelve columns">
  <div class="work__subheader">Company ethics</div>
  <p>
  <br>
   Building a non-profit from scratch also meant building what our company meant and the principles we wanted to follow. When a new
   member joined the team, we sent them a copy of our PPIP (Project Play Information Package), detailing what we expected of them and
   what they should expect of us.

  <div class="work__subheader">Website</div>
  <p>
  <br>
   Our goal in designing the website was to create a friendly, creative, and professional ambience to match our ethos.
   After some exploration, I went with gradients to portray our happy-go-lucky approach in every project.
   <div class="row">
     <div class="four columns"><img class="work__img" src="../img/work/project-play/landing-page.jpg" data-action="zoom" /></div>
     <div class="eight columns"><img class="work__img" src="../img/work/project-play/website-mockups.jpg" data-action="zoom" /></div>
   </div>
   <br>
   Through feedback from the team, I settled on using text placement and colours as the main visual components to control emphasis.
   Project Play was built by the team behind it, and we wanted our personality to shine more than words to explain away our mission statement.

<div class="twelve columns">
  <div class="work__subheader">Social media</div>
  <p>
  <br>
   Facebook was our main source of promotion, and with that in mind, it was important to design eye-grabbing posters. I developed a colour
   scheme for each of our events, applying it to our promotional posters while keeping the Project Play identity intact by placing our logo
   subtly within each design.
