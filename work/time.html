<div class="work__body">
  In Winter 2016, I created a three-part film series for the Parsons Challenge as part of my application
  to <a class="link" href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/">Parsons School of Design</a> in New York City.
  I was admitted with a merit scholarship of $10,000 per year over the course of the four-year program.
  The following is the video series alongside their respective artist statements.

    As the introduction to a three-part video series about time, “Zero” is meant to be replayed until your
    state of mind is contentious as it lingers lost in thought and in doubt of what the concept of time demands.
    It poses questions such as “what is time?”, “are we aware of time?”, and “is time infinite?” to set the
    atmosphere of where the rest of the series shall take the audience. “Zero” tells the story of time through
    questions, before the second video tells the story through words, and the last tells the story through music.
    <br>
    <br>
    The latter portion of the video attempts to display the ideology of time referred to as the eternal return.
    Friedrich Nietzsche describes the eternal return to be that the life we are currently living will be and has
    been relived innumerable times and that every event, thought, suffering, and pain we encounter will be
    experienced again. The idea thrives on ignorance; the absence of knowledge on the eternal return assists us in
    pushing through life more as we are unaware that it will return. Once you are aware that the eternal return
    exists, there is no way to forget that information. The latter portion of the video is displayed through a
    rotating circle that answers the questions posed in the former, but not explicitly stated. “Zero” acts as the
    introduction to the series but also the conclusion to the series as the answer is visible but only those who
    linger lost in thought about the overarching concept of time would dare to seek the answer.

    Death, like all things, is inevitable but as humans, we all fear death to some extent. Ernest Becker theorizes
    that everything is a form of death denial and we indulge ourselves in activities to distance ourselves from
    death. With that, we carry an anxiety about the future unlike any other being and this fear becomes our response
    to danger in life. This fear that we experience is what inspired “Blink”. Death exists but the time we have from
    the moment we are brought into this world to the moment we leave is in our control. The challenges we take, the
    experiences we have, and the people we meet are all variables that consume time but encompass our individual lives.
    Yet, rather than making the most of the limited time we have, most of us find ourselves always striving ahead,
    seeking opportunities to embark on in the future and not treasuring what is right in front of us.
    <br>
    <br>
    “Blink” is a short film that questions our definition of time and aims to persuade the audience to dive deeper in
    what it means to exist. Time as we know it can go on forever but our time on the planet we are so accustomed to
    will not. Once we are aware that death is inevitable, there is an unstoppable sensation to fit as much as we can
    into the time that we have. With “Blink”, the title speaks for itself. It is about taking a moment to smell the
    roses, to look out the window, to focus on something, but most importantly, to blink.

    Time moves slower when you are alone and this video explores the vulnerability that associates with loneliness.
    Everything comes in twos: socks, shoes, chopsticks, but the inevitability that we are all alone can haunt us in
    ways we cannot imagine until it happens to us.
    <br>
    <br>
    “Alone” is a music video that follows a teenager wandering around the park on a cloudy winter day by themselves.
    It is set in winter—the coldest season of the four— to emphasize the absence of warmth in the character’s life.
    Being alone can be a result of losing someone you care about and with that, you also lose the sense of comfort
    that being surrounded by loved ones deploy. The video is also set in a park because, particularly for myself, I
    find it to be a place that holds an abundance of childhood memories from deep conversations with a best friend to
    after-school soccer games to first kisses. However, it is also a place I always stumble back to when I need to sit
    down and just think. I can spend hours sitting on the grass contemplating about anything and everything, letting
    my mind overflow with ideas, but there is a fine line between being alone and being lonely. “Alone” walks that
    fine line between the two emotions and featuring Bon Iver’s “Beach Baby”, it touches on the feelings of yearning
    for the past but wishing to be hopeful for the future.
