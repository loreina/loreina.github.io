    As a software engineering intern at Figma, I got to implement and
    design some core features to the file management experience.

    Figma - Recovering deleted files
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that lives on the web. As a
    web product, users can collaborate on files that live on the cloud
    in real time. Unlike native design apps, Figma files are created
    through the web editor and users can navigate these files through an
    online file browser.
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    When I started my internship, deleted files were not recoverable. My
    project involved designing a solution for this.
  </div>

  <div class="work__body">
    Here's a short demo of the final implementation. I'll be discussing the
    process and the decisions we made in more details down below.

    Home of the deleted files
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    I started to figure out where the deleted files would be located.
    The view containing the deleted files could hold files at three different
    possible levels: global, team and project. For example, at a team level,
    each team would have a view showing all of the team's deleted files. The
    second option was a deleted toggle mode per view. Similar to how Dropbox has a
    button to show deleted files at any folder level, we considered having a
    toggle mode to show deleted files in the selected view.

  </div>


  <div class="work__body">
    As a team, we wanted to move away from having so many different modes within
    the product. Modes add additional state to the app, and as a result,
    complexity. Since the file editor was moving away from modes, we wanted to
    stay consistent with the editor and wanted to create a separate view for the
    deleted files instead.

  </div>

  <div class="work__body">
    Having an additional view created for each project or team created for the
    deleted files seemed really extra. The expectation is to create one entity
    during creation, and having the extra files adds unexpected behaviour as
    well as takes up a lot of extra space in the user's workspace. Through this
    discussion, it made most sense to have one global view where all deleted
    files live.

  <div class="work__subheader">
    Terminology
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    After agreeing on the location, we then had to define the terminology that
    fits best in the user's mental model of our file browser. For the user,
    what term best defines their deleted files? We narrowed down the options
    to "Deleted Files" and "Trash".
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    "Trash" defines a physical container that holds work that you don't want
    anymore. If a teammate deletes your shared work and suddenly,
    everyone else sees in their trash, it would be completely absurd in the
    physical world. Once something is in a trash, it should only belong in that
    trash.
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    This didn't fit in the mental model of the collaborative workspace Figma
    provides. Deleted Files resonates as a place where all files that have a
    deleted state live in. In the user's mind, all files should live in the same
    space, but are only separated per view by state. We decided to call the
    view "Deleted Files".
  </div>

  <div class="work__subheader">
    Organization of Deleted Files View
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    Within the Deleted Files view, it was important to figure out how we wanted
    to organize the information. The view contains deleted files that should be
    actionable.
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    Users already knew how to use our file browser and how it worked. It didn't
    make sense to train users to learn a different way of browsing through
    files, so we chose to adopt the same pattern and interaction used in the
    other file views.

  <div class="work__body">
    When a file gets deleted, the expectation is that they can see the file at
    the top of the deleted files view. It becomes an anti pattern to force the
    user to scroll to the bottom to find their deleted files.
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    In terms of the data shown on each file, users also care about who deleted
    the file to have a better understanding of the context of why the file is
    in Deleted Files in addition to the previous data shown before it was
    deleted.

  <div class="work__body">
    Since each file has different permission levels per user, it's important to
    define what actions are available per file. We decided to allow
    Restore, Delete Forever and Duplicate to Drafts.
  </div>

  <div class="work__subheader">
    Conclusion
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    This was my first design task in a professional setting and it was an
    extremely daunting one. As an initially very obvious feature, it slowly grew
    into a whole web of edge cases, especially after my work merged with the
    permission features.
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    I've learned so many things by going through this design process. Early
    feedback and introspection allowed me to improve myself for future design
    processes. I'm extremely thankful for the help of my mentor Jessica Liu and
    Rasmus Andersson for the help provided during the whole way.
  </div>

  <div class="work__subheader">
    Dev work
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    After finishing the design of file deletion and restoration, I implemented
    the full feature on both the frontend and the backend.
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    I worked on allowing multiple files to be selected at once as well as
    batch actions. I also helped on the UI for allowing teams to be created
    without a Slack team.
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    I've also invested in some performance work, reducing the initial load time
    of the file browser by several seconds depending on the user. The
    optimization led to a load time of under 1 second for most users.
  </div>
  <div class="work__body">
    Lastly, I've investigated bottlenecks in our incremental webpack builds and
    proposed solutions, bringing the build time from 9 seconds to 1 second.
